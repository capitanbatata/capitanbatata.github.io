What I like:

- Support in the thoracic region.
- Armrests.

What I do not like:

- No adjustable depth lumbar support. The chair is either for you or it isn't.
- Seat-pan comfort.

# First day

It was actually half a day.

I was testing the Aeris 3dee, and my lower back was in a bit of pain.

I started testing the Gesture at 15:30, so that meant that I had been working
for almost 6 hours, and my back was already fatigued.

The lumbar support feels very good. I will see if the pain in my lower back
changes.

I feel very good support under my shoulder blades. Specially on the right side.

I feel pain under my right thigh. I do not know whether it was due to the seat.
The seat is a bit harder than what I'd like.

# Second day

I still felt pain under the right thigh.

The seat pan is not uncomfortable. But I cannot help but thinking it'd be nice
if it was wider.

The arm rests are great. The best I ever tried. However, using the arm support
made my left hand hurt. I thing I tried lowering it a bit. This seemed to help.

# Third day

I'm using the highest setting of the adjustable lumbar support.

# Fourth day

My biggest complaint with the chair is the pressure it seems to put in my right
thigh.

I realized I was sitting with my right thigh on top of the rim of the chair,
which is quite hard. So this might have caused the pain in my legs. So now I'm
trying to pay more attention to the position of my legs, and I have to make
sure they are closer together.

I also lowered the chair a bit to try to reduce pressure on my thighs.

# Fifth day

The chair is at its lowest position. My legs are at a 90 degree angle. I still
feel some discomfort at the bottom of mi right thigh.

I lowered the armrests so that I'm only leaning on the elbows. However this
means that I have to put the table higher than the armrests.

Putting the forearms on the armrests makes my left hand hurt.

The good news is: I do not feel pain in my thoracic back in the beginning.
However I do feel pain in my lower back, but this might be due to my body
adapting to the chair.

The thoracic back pain seems to have returned after 3 hours into my workday.

# Sixth day

The pain in the right thigh continues.

# Seventh day
