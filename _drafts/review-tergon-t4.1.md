What I liked:

- Good lumbar support.
- Support between shoulder blades.
- Arm supports stay in place when reclining.
- Backrest-height adjustment.
- Seat tilt adjustment.

What I did not like:

- I did not notice much difference in the lumbar adjustment.
- Tension adjustment in the bottom of the chair hard to reach. Difficult for
  user to find a balance point. You have to turn it a lot.
- You cannot regulate the height of the support between the shoulder blades in
  relation with the lumbar support. So if your torso is larger or smaller than
  the back support you might not be using the shoulder blades support.
- Tilt lock mechanism is stepless. This makes it hard to reproduce your
  preferred lean angle.
- The headrest does not come forward enough. It is not useful like this.

# First try

- Let the seat loose.
- Played a bit with the counterpressure.

Impressions:

- Letting the seat loose gave me the feeling of being pushed out of the chair.
  I have to try fixing it and seeing what happens.

- I feel some discomfort between the shoulder blades. Lowering the counter
  pressure seems to help a bit.

# Second day

On the second day I locked the seat tilt. I also tried locking the back rest in
different positions.

I felt quite some pain between my shoulder blades. This is a new pain :) The
pain I used to have was below my right shoulder blade.

# Remaining days

I was still feeling pain in the thoracic region.

Locking the chair seemed to be what lessened the pain the most.
