This is my succinct review of the [Tergon Comfort
T4](https://www.tergon.com/comfort-officechairs/comfort-t41ll).

What I liked:

- Good lumbar support.
- Support between shoulder blades.
- Good arm supports.
- Arm supports stay in place when reclining.
- Backrest-height adjustment.
- Seat tilt adjustment.

What I did not like:

- The tension adjustment is in the bottom of the chair, which makes it very
  hard to reach. In addition, the adjustment is stepless and it takes a huge
  amount of turns to go from the lowest resistance (45 kilos) to the highest
  (135 kilos). As a result, finding a balance point is quite difficult, and I
  can imagine people will simple stop trying and use the chair in a fixed tilt
  position.
- The model I tried had a additional lumbar adjustment knob, but I did not
  notice much difference in the lumbar support when turning the knob. Maybe
  it's my lumbar area that is not very sensitive.
- You cannot regulate the height of the support between the shoulder blades in
  relation with the lumbar support. So if your torso is larger or smaller than
  the back support you might not be using the shoulder blades support.
- Tilt lock mechanism is also stepless. While this gives one a lot of
  flexibility, this also makes it hard to reproduce a preferred lean angle.
- The model I tried had a headrest. This headrest does not come forward enough,
  so even when leaning back for watching some video, or reading something on
  the screen the headrest will still be too far.

# First try

On the first day trying the chair I let the seat tilt unlocked, and played a
bit with the backrest counterpressure trying to find a balance point. Letting
the seat loose gave me the feeling of being pushed out of the chair. I also
felt some discomfort between the shoulder blades. Lowering the counter pressure
seemed to help a bit.

# Second day

On the second day I locked the seat tilt, to avoid feeling I was pushed out of
the chair. I also tried locking the back rest in different positions.

I felt quite some pain between my shoulder blades. This is a new pain :) The
pain I used to have was below my right shoulder blade.

# Remaining days

I was still feeling pain in the thoracic region. Locking the chair seemed to be
what lessened the pain the most.
