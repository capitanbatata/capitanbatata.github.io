I liked this chair better than the Tergon, however there are several aspects in
which this chair falls short.

What I liked:

- The support in the middle portion of the back seems quite solid.

What I did not like:

- Pressure on my thighs.
- Lack of ability to recline (when reading or watching something).
- Poor lumbar support.

# Final impressions

Sitting near the edge without using the backrest reduces my thoracic back pain,
but I cannot sustain this position for very long since I start feeling pain in
my lower back.

My high mechanical keyboard makes it hard to use the table as support for my
forearms. I tried placing a towel under my forearms, but typing became
inaccurate and uncomfortable. So this configuration seems to put more pressure
on my wrists.

Using the back support seems to bring back the thoracic back pain.

The sitting area is not very comfortable: it puts more pressure on the legs
than I would like to.

# How I reached this conclusion

## First try

I'm trying not to use the back support, just to see how it feels.

When I'm not using the back support I do not feel much thoracic pain in the
first couple of minutes.

## Second day

What I like about the chair is the support in the middle region of the back
(thoracic).

What I dislike is the pressure it puts in my thighs.

## Third day

I lowered the chair a bit to decrease pressure on my thighs. This made the
chair feel more comfortable.

Compared with the Tergon chair, this chair seems to reduce my thoracic back
pain somehow.

I still feel the lack of armrests. I cannot use the table with the kind of
keyboard I have (an ergodox, which is quite high).

## Fourth day

I tried putting a towel under my forearms. Typing feels a bit weird.

Without towel it feels less weird.

Putting both arms on the table makes my left arm hurt. I do not know why.

I really like the back support in the middle region.
