## The Good

- We are explicit about the part of the state that we're changing.
- It forces me to reason about the system: I had to use pencil and paper,
  instead of coding an idea directly.
- We focus on the essential. When changing the spec we change the essential,
  without having to change the implementation details!
- It forces me to be minimalistic:
  - horizontal space is limited
  - we do not want states to grow out of control
  - where is the right place to handle something
